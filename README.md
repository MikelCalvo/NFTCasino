# NFTCasino
Sample project I'm coding while learning Solidity.

The goal is to create a series of smart contracts that allows a users to bet one NFT at 50% odds against another user.
Winner gets both NFTs.

To prevent shitty NFTs be gambled against valuable NFTs we will only allow a bet to happen when the two gambled NFTs are from the same collection.
